This is a Vehicles detection & Counting project using Computer Vision.

In This video : Total Vehicles detected number is 23

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and some morphological transformation for accuracy.

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded
when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object ids I defined a class called vehicles.py

For running it, just download all files and run the main.py
